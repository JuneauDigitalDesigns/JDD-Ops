// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// LeadForm — the ONE lead-capture form for the whole catalog.
//
// WHY IT LIVES IN lib/ AND NOT components/catalog/
// `placeComponents` (console/src/lib/export.ts) copies only the component files a
// client actually selected. Anything shared between components has to arrive via
// `copyTemplate` instead, which copies `template/` wholesale — so shared UI must
// sit in `src/lib`. That is the same reason `editable.tsx` lives here. Putting
// this under components/catalog/ would build in the console and then fail in
// every exported repo.
//
// WHAT IT REPLACES
// Thirteen components each carried their own copy of this: useState for every
// field, a hand-rolled fetch, and a `status` union. Three problems that repeated
// verbatim in all of them:
//
//   1. Inputs had a `placeholder` and no `<label>`. A placeholder is not an
//      accessible name — it is announced inconsistently and vanishes on input.
//   2. `setStatus('error')` was set and then never rendered. A failed POST showed
//      the user nothing at all: the form simply sat there and the lead was lost
//      silently. That is the worst possible failure for the one element on the
//      page that makes money.
//   3. No `aria-invalid`, no error text tied to the field.
//
// LEAD MODE
// `phone` for growth/enterprise (the Retell agent calls the lead back), `email`
// for starter (Resend emails the owner). This prop is what lets one component
// serve both plans, and is why the seven `*Starter` duplicates could be deleted.
// /api/contact builds its owner email from whatever fields are posted, so adding
// a field here needs no route change.
//
// SMS CONSENT
// The disclosure under the phone field is the only record that the customer was
// ever told they could be texted, and `consent.textHash` in the POST body is the
// evidence of it. Both come from one constant in ./lead-consent-text — the
// rendered copy is never retyped as JSX, or it drifts from the hashed copy one
// careless edit at a time. Two rules that are easy to break from in here:
//
//   1. Never post a `consent` object unless the disclosure actually rendered.
//      A hash of words nobody saw is manufactured evidence, and that is worse
//      than none: the portal's gate fails closed on a missing object and shows
//      the owner the reason, which is a recoverable state. A false hash is not.
//   2. The disclosure is wired to the phone input with `aria-describedby`, not
//      left as a loose <p>. In notice mode it is the only thing that tells a
//      screen-reader user what giving the number means, and a sibling paragraph
//      next to an input is never announced with it.
//
// CALL CONSENT
// A phone-mode form is one the AI receptionist will call back, so it carries a
// required, unticked box naming the business and the AI voice. `callConsent` is
// posted only when the box was ticked. /api/contact checks it again and won't
// dial without it, so this is the first gate, not the only one.
